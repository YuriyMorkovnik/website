			`I'm a seasoned developer with experience in startups, consulting, and mobile apps. I specialize in front-end work, creating microservices, and wonderful projects. I've passed React from the beginning, dived into micro frontends and lamdas, tackled legacy code and had plenty cups of coffee creating amazing web interfaces.

			My skills span React, Redux, NodeJS, AWS, and more. I'm serious about delivering results and making tech dreams come true. Let's discuss your project and make it happen.

					Role: I led the front-end team, like a rockstar leading a band, creating cool features such as customizable dashboards, a form builder, and even a built-in messenger for office gossip. I also dabbled in agile philosophy and did my fair share of code reviews - didn't spot any hidden jokes, though.
